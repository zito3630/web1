  <h2>JAVASCRIPT<h2>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS,</a> is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often
        just-in-time compiled, and
        multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. <img src="https://s3-ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/opentutorials-user-file/module/3135/7648.png" width="100%">

        Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page
        behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
        As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and
        the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
